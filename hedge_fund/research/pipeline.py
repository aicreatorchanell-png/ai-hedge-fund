"""Controlled self-improvement: candidates move forward only through gates.

    CANDIDATE -> BACKTESTED -> VALIDATED -> STRESS_TESTED -> HOLDOUT_PASSED
      -> PAPER -> LIVE_CANDIDATE (human approval)          any stage -> REJECTED

Who may do what:

    AI (actor "ai:<model>")   propose a candidate (a spec for a registered strategy
                              type), attach reviews/critiques/failure analyses.
                              Nothing else.
    system                    advance a candidate one stage at a time, only with the
                              evidence that stage requires (Python-computed gate
                              results, a locked-holdout result, paper metrics).
    human ("human:<name>")    the only actor who can approve LIVE_CANDIDATE, and the
                              only one allowed to perform protected actions.

Protected actions — changing risk limits, validation thresholds or the locked
holdout, promoting to live, raising leverage, disabling the kill switch — are
refused for any non-human actor, whatever the request says. Every event is
written to the experiment registry.
